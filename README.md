# ProductivityExtension
This is a chrome/opera gx extension built with the aim to make users are more productive. The simple task the extension does is if it sees that the user is on  or "www.reddit.com" or "www.instagram.com" or "www.twitter.com" the extension will run a timer for 30 mins and at the beginning the extension will
alert the user it has only 30 mins to use and then it gets blocked. ALso the extension keeps track of how many times a user tried to open a certain website.

Main use of this extension : to limit a users usage of any of these websites to 30 mins although the websites can be accessed again by reloading it gives the user the sense of 
time they have spent on there and show how many times they tried to open respective website.

future plans: 
1. To make it so user can add the time they want to spend on the respective website in minutes.
2. Make it look better.
3. add a timer which the user can look at.
4. make a better icon.
5. make it so access count refreshes daily.  
6. Also make it so the alert does not come on all urls.
